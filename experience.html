         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p>This is a discussion of how to index and present metadata with possibly innumerable number of fields.
        We reject the idea to use the joins and hierarchically structured documents in a search engine like SOLR.</p>
         <p>Instead we turn to the dumb down concept used by metadata
        communities to describe what goes on when crosswalking a
        complex metadata system with a more shallow, less detailed
        one.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          The Royal Danish Library has been using the <a href="#solr">Solr</a> search engine for at least a
          decade. Almost all projects that need some search facilities
          are using it. A Swiss army knife for searching in small as
          well as well as big data sets. A trusty tool that provide
          many advantages to the alternative to use a relational
          database management system (RDBMS) when working with
          resource discovery systems.
        </p>
      <p>
          At the first Solr workshop I participated the teacher reiterated over
          and over again that Solr is a search engine, not a data management
          tool. Although Solr can Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete
          <a href="#crud">(CRUD)</a>
          documents, the transactions cannot really be characterized as having
          Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
          <a href="#acid">(ACID)</a>
      </p>
      <h2>The role of bibliographic structure</h2>
      <p>In a library we encounter data with much more structure
        than simple packages of attributes and values, but also much
        less structure than what you expect from data in <a href="#normal-form">database normal
        form</a>. Bibliographical data may <strong>for
        instance</strong> describe texts that</p>
      <ul>
         <li>have one or more titles, each having different type (main title, subtitle, translated title, transcribed title, uniform title to iterate some of the frequently used ones)</li>
         <li>may have one or more authors that may be persons or organizations</li>
         <li>each of which may have dates of birth and death</li>
         <li>and an affiliation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we were using a RDBMS, the data on persons could be stored in one
        database table, the titles in another and there could be a third table
        keeping track (through joins and foreign keys) of each person's
        relations to the works to which they've contributed. Someone made the
        illustrations, someone else wrote the texts. A third one made the
        graphical design.</p>
      <p>For a portrait photograph we have one person being the
        photographer, and another being the subject. The data on the
        subject can be as important as the data on the artist.</p>
      <p>These data are important. For instance the dates are used
        for distinguishing between people with the same name. (The
        digital phone book krak.dk lists 43 now living persons named
        Søren Kierkegaard, while the philosopher died 1855). An importand use
        case is how to decide whether a given object is free from
        copyright or not, such as when the originator has been dead
        for more than 75 years.</p>
      <p>Add to this that there are many more complications, like we
        may have multiple copies of a given title and that each copy
        may belong to different collections with very different
        provenance. For historical objects we may even have a
        manuscript in the manuscript and rare books collections and a
        modern pocket book in the open stocks.</p>
      <p>The role of the primary purpose of these data are to enable
        library patrons and service users to search and
        retrieve. Typically users type a single word in the search
        form, while ignoring the handful of fields that we provide
        through the effort of catalogers, software developers etc.</p>
      <p>The user gets a far too long list of results which contains
        author, title and perhaps some subjects or keywords. Again
        typically, the user clicks on a title an gets a landing
        page. This is far more detailed; it presents many fields that
        will enable users to decide whether to order or retrieve the
        object.</p>
      <p>If we grossly simplify the process, a user might be up to
        one of two things: (1) Finding or resolving a given reference,
        i.e., the right object, perhaps the right edition. Or (2)
        Finding information on a given topic. See these two as
        endpoints on a scale.</p>
      <p>You may look for a particular book <em>Enten —  Eller
        (Either/Or)</em> by Kierkegaard
        (1843) or you might be interested in the role of
        this philosopher in your study of the origin of
        existentialism. In the former case you actually look for
        Kierkegaard in the author field, in the latter case you look
        for him in subject field.</p>

      <h2>Encoding, indexing and using</h2>
      <p>Assume we are about to add metadata on <em>Enten —  eller</em> by
        Søren Kierkegaard into a Solr index. What we get for that
        book might contain the data below. The example is encoded in a
        format called Metadata Object Description
        Schema (<a href="#mods">MODS</a>). Note that the
        namespace prefix `md` stands for the URI
        `http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3`</p>
      <pre>
        &lt;md:titleInfo&gt;
           &lt;md:title&gt;Enten - eller&lt;/md:title&gt;
           &lt;md:subTitle&gt;Et livsfragment&lt;/md:subTitle&gt;
        &lt;/md:titleInfo&gt;

        &lt;md:name displayLabel="Author"
                 type="personal"
                 authorityURI="https://viaf.org/viaf/7392250/"

           &lt;md:alternativeName altType="pseudonym"&gt;
              &lt;md:namePart&gt;Victor Eremita&lt;/md:namePart&gt;

              &lt;md:description&gt;“Victorious hermit,” general editor of
              Either/Or, who also appears in the first part of its
              sequel, Stages on Life’s Way. Also the author of the
              satirical article “A Word of Thanks to Professor
              Heiberg.”&lt;/md:description&gt;

           &lt;/md:alternativeName&gt;
           &lt;md:role&gt;
              &lt;md:roleTerm type="code"&gt;aut&lt;/md:roleTerm&gt;
           &lt;/md:role&gt;
        &lt;/md:name&gt;
        
        &lt;md:originInfo&gt;
           &lt;md:dateCreated&gt;1843&lt;/md:dateCreated&gt;
           &lt;md:publisher&gt;Universitetsboghandler C. A. Reitzel&lt;/md:publisher&gt;
        &lt;/md:originInfo&gt;

        </pre>
      <p>This is a fake record I created for the purpose of this
        paper.  The work has a title and a
        name, which has a role (which is
        aut as in author). The name also has
        multiple parts like family name (Kierkegaard), given name
        (Søren) and a date (1813/1855 which is ISO's way to express a
        <a href="#dc-terms-date">date</a> range i.e., the years
        between which the philosopher was alive. His Fragment of Life.)</p>
      <p>To get the birth and death dates you have to parse a
        string. As a matter of fact, the name on the book cover wasn't
        Søren Kierkegaard but Victor Eremita
        (Victorious hermit), encoded as an (<kbd>&lt;alternativeName&gt; ... &lt;/alternativeName&gt;</kbd>). A
        telling pseudonym of the author of The Seducer's Diary.  Søren
        was good at <a href="#pseudonyms">pseudonyms</a>.</p>
      <p>The <kbd>&lt;md:role&gt; ... &lt;/md:role&gt;</kbd> permits the
        cataloger to encode that a person called Søren
        has the <kbd>aut</kbd> relation to the
        work. Library of Congress have lists with houndreds of such
        <a href="#relators">relators</a>. Actually, each of
        those could be seen as a field. The thing is that even in a
        large bibliographic database there would be very few records
        where Data manager (<kbd>dtm</kbd>), Former owner (<kbd>fmo</kbd>) and Librettist (<kbd>lbt</kbd>) would contain any data.</p>
      <p>Now we've identified a lot of possible fields to use, for
        cataloging and for information retrieval. They have perfectly
        reasonable use cases, and all of them are used in everyday
        library practice, so how do I get them into my Solr index?</p>
      <h2>The attempt</h2>
      <p>We have tried to put such records into Solr. The attempt
        was successful. In the rest of this paper I will outline how
        we did that, learn you a bit on how to use such an index and
        finally why decided not to implement it.</p>
      <p>In our experiments we transformed MODS records to nested
        Solr records, such as the record below, which is transformed
        from my fake record above.</p>

        </pre>
      <p>If you are familiar with the workings of Solr, you know that the
        data-model (if I may label it as such) used is configured in a file
        call `schema.xml`. It basically contains list of fields that can be
        used in what is referred to as `Solr documents`. In such a schema you
        may add 
        </p>
      <pre>
        &lt;field     name="_nest_path_" 
                   type="_nest_path_" 
                   stored="true" 
                   indexed="true" /&gt;

        &lt;field     name="_nest_parent_" 
                   type="string" 
                   indexed="true" 
                   stored="true" /&gt;
        </pre>
      <p>the former of which is of the following type:</p>
      <pre>
        &lt;fieldType name="_nest_path_" class="solr.NestPathField" /&gt;
        </pre>
      <p>See the Solr <a href="https://github.com/siglun/danish-sonnets/blob/main/nested-documents">Indexing Nested Child
        Documents</a> documentation.</p>
      <p>The nested indexing works since the indexer stores an xpath like
        entity for each record, making it possible track which Solr
        document which is parent and which document which is child which is
        the parent. That info is in the <kbd>_nest_path_</kbd> field and Solr does
        that automatically whenever it starts a new document inside a
        parent one.</p>
      <p>You will get that information back from the server if you add a
        Solr field list argument (<kbd>fl</kbd>) at search
        time</p>
      <pre>
        fl=*,[child]
        </pre>
      <p>That is straight forward. The problem is then to make Solr
        search in the child documents and return the parent or root
        document.</p>
      <pre>

{!parent which="described:true"}
         {!edismax v="agent_name:(Kierkegaard Søren) AND entity_type:aut"}

AND

{!parent which="described:true"}
         {!edismax v="title:(Enten - eller) AND entity_type:tit"}

        </pre>
      <p>The constructs {!parent ... } and
        {!edismax ... } are so called local parameters in a
        Solr request. The former specifies that we want Solr to return
        parent documents such the described:true, the latter tells Solr we
        want the author to be Søren and title to be Enten  — eller. Now we
        can reasonably easy search and retrieve information on the
        Etcher (<kbd>etr</kbd>) and
        Dancer (<kbd>dnc</kbd>), when
        applicable.</p>
      <p>This is a special case of <kbd>join</kbd> as
        implemented in Solr. Recall that joins are at very very core of
        <kbd>SQL</kbd>, and one of the features making the
        RDBMS such a powerful tool.</p>
      <p>Also recall that I mentioned that my first Solr instructor
        dissuaded us from using search engines as data stores. Does that
        generalize to other features coming from the database world?</p>
      <h2>The user problems</h2>
      <p>I hope I've been able to convince you that the fairly
        complicated metadata structures used in libraries are useful for
        patrons and staff. They were not invented for giving software
        developers gray hair and age prematurely. Also, it is legitimate
        use case to be able to identify the etchers and the dancers.</p>
      <p>However:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>We do, however, know that users at of our resources are not very
          good at using fields. An interface allowing you to search
          portraiture subjects is very specialized use case. So is the use
          case to be able to search for senders and recipients of letters.</li>
         <li> People do search for word in a title, but they do not search
          for A life fragment separate from
          Either/or. Likewise they not particularly interested
          in making a difference between Enten — eller
          and Either/or. If they search for the latter they
          presumably want an English translation, but when studying a detailed
          presentation they are almost certainly interested to know that
          Either/or is actually a translation.</li>
         <li>You know, each performance of Весна священная (AKA The Rite
          of Spring) has a conductor, director and choreographer and a lot of
          dancers, obviously in addition to Стравинский, Игорь Фёдорович
          (AKA Stravinsky, Igor Fyodorovich the composer). I could go on here. You could
          add from your own experience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          To make a useful service we have to aggregate data into reasonable
          headlines. _[Dublin Core Metadata
          Initiative](https://www.dublincore.org/)_ has actually a name for
          this: The [Dumb-Down
          Principle](https://www.dublincore.org/resources/glossary/dumb-down_principle/)
        </p>
      <h2>The developer problems</h2>
      <p>From the developers point of view, metadata dumb-down can take place,
        either (i) when indexing or (ii) when searching.</p>
      <p>In either case, for a ballet performance we would dumb-down
        _Composer_ ((<kbd>cmp</kbd>), Conductor ((<kbd>cnd</kbd>), Director ((<kbd>drt</kbd>) and Choreographer ((<kbd>chr</kbd>) to one single repeatable field
        [creator](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/terms/creator/). It
        would contain Igor Stravinsky (the transcribed, but perhaps
        also his name in Cyrillic), and obviously all other
        creatives. Most of the dancers would most likely go to the <a href="#contributor">contributor</a>
        field.</p>
      <p>Doing dumb-down at indexing would mean to create fields <kbd>creator</kbd> and
        <kbd>contributor</kbd> in the index, to do it when searching would imply to do
        it using the horrendous search syntax presented above. Then you have
        to do the same for title and other relevant fields.</p>
      <p>In the case of <em>Either/or</em>, <em>Enten  — eller</em> the dumb-down solr record
        would look somewhat as the record below:</p>
      <pre>
        [
           {
           "id": "https:!!example.org!record",
           "title": [
              "Enten  &amp;#8212; eller"
           ],
           "creator": [
              "Kierkegaard, Søren 1813/1855"
           ],
           "record_created": "2022-08-12",
           "visible_date": [
              "1843"
           ],
           "original_object_identifier": [],
           "pages": []
           }
        ]
        </pre>
      <p>Hence when indexing we only create one record, and no joins are
        needed. A query could be</p>
      <pre>
        creator:kierkegaard AND title:(enten eller)
        </pre>
      <p>The drawback being that the in the index we cannot tell the
        difference between Igor Stravinsky (<kbd>cmp</kbd>) and the Conductor
        (<kbd>cnd</kbd>). Both are creators. The dumbed-down index has lost most of
        the information you need to decide whether you want to listen to an
        album or see a performance.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>At indexing: Your search syntax is nice and clean. You have to use
          some other method to present the data in the detailed view.</li>
         <li>At search: Your search syntax is very complicated. On the other
          hand, you have all the data needed for the detailed view.</li>
         <li>At a practical level, the nested Solr seems more or less
          experimental, and the documentation is less than excellent. Only
          the <a href="https://github.com/siglun/danish-sonnets/blob/main/lucene_query_parser">lucene query parser</a>
          supports it, and when searching with (for example) <kbd>edismax</kbd> query
          parser you run into the syntactic problem with local parameters
          demonstrated above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we are to describe the situation in Model-View-Controller (MVC)
        terms, the second (i.e., the at search implementation) looks nice. One
        model, one controller but (perhaps) two views. When doing it at
        indexing, we need two models and an architecture diagram might look
        much more messy. Semantic exercise to make the dumb-down scheme might
        seem complicated. The code, however, is much simplified.</p>
      <p>The fact that each substructure in the nested Solr document
        must follow the same schema is an annoying feature. It isn't
        important, but persons, subjects and whatever all have the same
        content model (in the sense of an XML DTD or Schema), makes the setup
        much less attractive.</p>
      <p>Finally, it is my experience that it easier to accommodate
        multiple metadata models and standards in the same index with
        dumb-down at indexing. In our case we opted for transforming
        our MODS records to the <a href="#schema.org">schema.org</a> ontology for the
        detailed presentation. Hence, retrieval will be from a
        separate datastore. The schema.org ontology is rich enough for
        our landing pages and detailed result sets. It provides an
        extra bonus, we hope, in that Google would actually be able to
        index our collection.</p>
      <p>The only advantage I can see with at search time dumb-down is that we
        would have only a single model in our search application.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In the end, after some weeks work, we threw out our nested
        indexing stuff and most likely we a threw out some baby we
        were not aware of with the bathwater. Be that as it may, we
        opted for an easy format for search, while retaining detail
        for presentation, and interoperability for other uses.</p>
      <p>Library patrons have more needs than resource
        discovery. Some use APIs for study, research or for services
        of their own. The search index, schema.org, the original mods
        will eventually be available for such purposes. It could be
        that a nested index could actually be useful for such
        users.</p>
